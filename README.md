  * Insertion Sort
  * Heap Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Bitonic Sort

* **Interactive UI:**

  * Individual buttons for each algorithm
  * Hover over buttons to see a **concise description** and **worst-case time complexity**

* **Retro Hacker Aesthetic:**

  * Clean **black interface** with **green text**
  * Classic “terminal-style” look for a sleek and minimal feel

* **Engaging Experience:**

  * Audio feedback for **hover** and **click events**
  * Real-time sorting visualization for clear understanding

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is an **educational tool** aimed at students, developers, and anyone interested in algorithms. It allows users to:
